# DiscordLogBot
Saves all discord server text messages into an organized JSON file.

A server bot is required, and you must input the bot ticket at the start of the program to record.

Create your own server bot here: https://discord.com/developers/applications

This program is useful if you want to save all conversations in a discord channel locally on your computer, even if you lose access to it. It is none of my business as to why you would want to use this.
